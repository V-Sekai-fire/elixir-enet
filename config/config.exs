# This file is responsible for configuring your application
# and its dependencies with the aid of the Mix.Config module.
#
# This configuration file is loaded before any dependency and
# is restricted to this project.

import Config

# Configures the application
config :enet,
  # Add application-specific configuration here
  []

# It is also possible to import configuration files, relative to this
# directory. For example, you can emulate configuration per environment
# by uncommenting the line below and defining dev.exs, test.exs and such.
# Configuration from the imported file will override the ones defined
# here (which is why it is important to import them last).

#     import_config "#{Mix.env()}.exs"
